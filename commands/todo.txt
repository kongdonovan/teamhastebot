Todo list for this:
    - Come up with an args helper: Done (may still need to fix edge cases as needed)
    - Add/remove channels (for manager roles only)
    - Database integration to easily keep track of stuff
    - Roblox commands (make something similar to Echelon maybe)
    - Music functionality (YT, Spotify)
    - Edge case in lovecalculate where it doesnt show username if you ping someone
